# 🐍 Daily Python Challenge – Day 8  

## 🎯 Number Guessing Game  

### 📌 Task:  
Create a **Number Guessing Game** where the program:  
- **Generates a random number** between 1 and 100.  
- **Asks the user to guess** the number.  
- **Gives hints** whether the guess is too high or too low.  
- **Continues until the user guesses the correct number.**  

### 📝 Example Usage:  
#### **Input:**  
- Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 45.
  Too low! Try again.
- Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 75.
  Too high! Try again.
- Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 63.
Congratulations! You guessed it right!


### 💡 Hints:  
- Use **`random.randint(1, 100)`** to generate a number.  
- Use a **`while` loop** to keep the game running.  
- Use **`if-elif-else`** to check guesses and give hints.  

### 🚀 Learning Outcome:  
- Python Loops & Conditions
