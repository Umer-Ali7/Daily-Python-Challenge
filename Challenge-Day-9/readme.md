## 🎯 Password Strength Checker  

### 📌 Task:  
Create a **Password Strength Checker** that evaluates a user's password and categorizes it as **Weak, Moderate, or Strong.**  

### 📜 Rules for Password Strength:  
- **Weak:** Password is **less than 6 characters** or contains only alphabets.  
- **Moderate:** Password is **8+ characters long**, but **no special characters.**  
- **Strong:** Password is **8+ characters long**, contains **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.**  

### 📝 Example Usage:  
#### **Input & Output:**  
Enter your password: hello123
Password Strength: Weak ❌
<br>
Enter your password: PythonMaster22
Password Strength: Moderate ⚠️
<br>
Enter your password: C0d3@Python2024!
Password Strength: Strong ✅


### 💡 Hints:  
- Use **`len(password)`** to check password length.  
- Use **`re.search()`** from **`re` module** to check for uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  
- Use **`if-elif-else`** conditions to classify password strength.
