# 🐍 Daily Python Challenge – Day 4  
## 🔥 Challenge: Convert Numbers to Words  

### 📌 Problem Statement  
Your task is to write a Python program that **converts any given number into words**. For example:  
- `123` → `"One Hundred Twenty-Three"`  
- `5067` → `"Five Thousand Sixty-Seven"`  

### 🔹 Example  
Input: 85
Output: "Eighty-Five"

Input: 1001
Output: "One Thousand One"


### 💡 Hints  
✔ **Use a dictionary** to map numbers (0-19, 20, 30, ..., 90, 100, 1000, etc.).  
✔ Use **divmod()** to break numbers into smaller parts.  
✔ Handle special cases like `10-19` separately.  
✔ Try recursion or loops for numbers beyond hundreds and thousands.  

### ✅ Expected Learning  
By solving this challenge, you will:  
1️⃣ Learn **dictionary-based mapping** in Python.  
2️⃣ Improve your **number manipulation skills**.  
3️⃣ Understand **string formatting and logic building**.  

🔥 **Give it a try and push your Python skills to the next level!** 🚀
